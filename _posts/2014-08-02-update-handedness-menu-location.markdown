A while back I wrote how to change the [handedness]({% post_url 2014-05-15-menu-wrong-side-touch-screen %}) (which seems to be the correct term, instead of the dreadful 'Menu on the wrong side with a touch screen').

I got a machine in my hands which exhibited the previously mentioned problem. However Tablet PC SettingsÂ weren't installed, so we couldn't open the tab.

After searching the bowels of the internet I found the following shell shortcut:

    
    shell:::{80F3F1D5-FECA-45F3-BC32-752C152E456E}


Putting this in Winkey+R, or in the Windows 7/8(.1) search box will open the Tablet PC Settings, and if you don't have a touch screen, will default to the Other tab, where you can change the handedness of your menus!

Have a good one,
